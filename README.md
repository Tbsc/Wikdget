# Wikdget
Third iteration of the Wiktionary widget, this time for any language

### Features
Enter a word and it'll show you the Wiktionary entry of that word for the language selected.
Supports playing a clip of the word's pronunciation (if available) and showing inflections (per language support).


### History
After making a [Wiktionary widget](https://github.com/Tbsc/DutchHelper-v2) that only supported Dutch, I started learning Italian. Instead of working through that mess of a code to make it support another language, I'm making a new Wiktionary widget, based upon the old one, with support for any language.
